# Pandas-In-Making
Building a Data Analysis Library similar to Pandas from Scratch.

This repository contains a detailed project, how to build our own Python data analysis library from scratch. The end result will be a fully-functioning library very similar to pandas.

## Pre-Requisites

* Basic types and common data structures (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries)
* Control flow with if/else statements and for loops (especially when iterating through lists or dictionaries)
* Raising and handling exceptions
* Basics of classes and object-oriented programming.
* Numpy library.

## Objectives

* Have a DataFrame class with data stored in numpy arrays
* Select subsets of data with the brackets operator
* Use special methods defined in the Python data model
* Have a nicely formatted display of the DataFrame in the notebook
* Implement aggregation methods - sum, min, max, mean, median, etc...
* Implement non-aggregation methods such as isna, unique, rename, drop
* Group by one or two columns
* Have methods specific to string columns
* Read in data from a comma-separated value file
